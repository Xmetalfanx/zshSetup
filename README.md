# zshSetup

## Goal

While I may in fact do the same thing I did with my [Linux Setup Scripts](https://github.com/Xmetalfanx/linuxSetup).  The goal for right now is similiar to the origins of that project.  A way to setup zsh (Linux in the other case) fast on a fresh setup.

Menus and "Do you want to install A or B?" type things may come later but this is just a fast set of tasks I have tossed together for now .. again like the origins of my [Linux Setup Scripts](https://github.com/Xmetalfanx/linuxSetup).

## Credits

The harcoded plugins I include belong to their projects and developers .. I am not even sure i am keeping these hard-coded in... ALL CREDIT for their code goes to them
